    "# Analysis Ideas for Search Queries from Outdoors site\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Client has a log of all keyword searches that have been submitted to their outdoors site for the past five years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search results include a number of comma-separated columns, but the only data column of interest right now are the search query terms submitted by site users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each search query submission is a single string of one or more space-separated words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Client already has a set of lists of the names of Rivers, Towns, Trips and Runs.  He would like to know the frequency (proportion) of searches that:\n",
    "- are one or another type of {rivers, towns, trips or runs} e.g. \"ohio\" = {river} [assuming no word exists in > 1 list/category]\n",
    "- for each category, which list entry is most frequently requested e.g. \"colorado\" is the most frequently-searched river\n",
    "- only request one type of data (only strings that are included in the category lists) vs. those requests that include filtering terminology (e.g. \"x river\" vs \"x river rafting\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code ideas\n",
    "- list.remove(string) # will remove the first instance of a string - can reuse the remove_all() function I defined\n",
    "- string.split(' ') # will break apart the search query string into tokens\n",
    "- x in y # will test whether string 'x' appears in list 'y' [remembering that strings are also lists]\n",
    "- I could add new fields to the CSV (or a new CSV) for each search entry, to indicate things like\n",
    "- - category it belongs to\n",
    "- - does it include the filtering term (True/False)\n",
    "- - Stripping quotes around strings in CSV fields is automatic for the CSV module: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1707558/can-python-remove-double-quotes-from-a-string-when-reading-in-text-file"
