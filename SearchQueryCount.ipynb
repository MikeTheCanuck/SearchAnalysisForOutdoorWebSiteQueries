    "# Count the search queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a count of how many times each search query (set of query words) has been submitted to the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Example\n",
    "Users have submitted three search queries to the site - \"Indiana\", \"Indiana\" and \"Indiana River\".  This code will return the following results:\n",
    "- the query \"Indiana\" was submitted 2 times\n",
    "- the query \"Indiana River\" was submitted 1 times\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- because various users have submitted the same search query phrases but used different casing (e.g. \"Indiana\" vs \"indiana\"), the code renders all queries to lowercase for ease of comparison - this has the unfortunate side effect of making proper names harder to spot in the output"
